# LinkedIn Post: Team Development Workflow

## Version 1: Technical (For engineers)

**From Linear Ticket to Merged PR in 8 Deterministic Phases**

I built a workflow that eliminates the "forgot to write tests" problem.

Type `work on ENG-123` and watch:

**Phase 0:** Fetches ticket. Detects labels. Creates branch.

**Phases 1-4:** Launches code-explorer agents. Designs architecture. Forces you to answer every question BEFORE coding.

**Phase 5:** Writes tests FIRST. Then ralph-wiggum iterates until ALL pass. No shortcuts allowed.

**Phase 7:** Quality gates. Tests, linting, type checking, build. All must pass. Hard stop.

**Phase 8:** Commits. Creates PR. Syncs Linear. Done.

**The key:** Label-based routing.
- `pre-planned` → Skip discovery, go straight to implementation
- `ui` → Use frontend-design plugin
- `spike` → Stop after architecture

Built on Jeremy O'Dell's PAI framework using Claude Code.

The result: 100% test coverage. Zero broken builds. Every ticket follows the same flow.

## Version 2: Business Value (For leaders)

**How I Eliminated "I Forgot to Write Tests"**

My team had a discipline problem:
→ 30% of tickets shipped without tests
→ Broken builds twice a month
→ PRs blocked by linting errors after commits

So I built a workflow that makes discipline automatic.

One command: `work on ENG-123`

Eight phases: Ticket fetch → Discovery → Architecture → TDD Implementation → Code Review → Quality Gates → Ship

The workflow won't let you skip steps. Can't commit without tests. Can't ship with failing builds. Can't create PRs without passing linting.

Built using Jeremy O'Dell's PAI framework and Claude Code plugins.

**The metrics after 2 months:**
✅ 100% test coverage (enforced)
✅ Zero broken builds
✅ Quality gates pass before every commit
✅ Every developer follows identical flow

When discipline becomes automatic, quality becomes inevitable.

## Version 3: Story Format (For broader audience)

**The Problem with Discipline**

At 11 PM, staring at a PR that's been in review for 3 days, I realized: I forgot to write tests.

Again.

This time I decided to fix the system, not my willpower.

I built a workflow called `team-dev-workflow` that makes testing automatic:

→ Type `work on ENG-123`
→ It fetches the Linear ticket
→ Explores your codebase with AI agents
→ Designs the architecture
→ Forces you to write tests FIRST
→ Iterates until every test passes
→ Runs quality gates (all must pass)
→ Creates the PR
→ Syncs Linear

No human discipline required.

The result: 2 months without a single broken build.

Built on Jeremy O'Dell's PAI framework using Claude Code.

When you can't trust yourself at 11 PM, trust the system.
