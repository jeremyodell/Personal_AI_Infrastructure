# PlanToLinear - Feature Planning to Linear Stories

**Streamlined workflow from idea to pre-planned Linear tickets.**

Integrates:
- **feature-dev** - Backend architecture and design
- **frontend-design** - UI/UX design and component planning
- **superpowers:writing-plans** - Story decomposition with dependencies
- **Linear MCP** - Ticket creation with nested hierarchy

---

## Overview

Replaces ideate with a faster workflow that:
- Detects frontend/backend/both automatically
- Uses existing design skills (stops before implementation)
- Creates separate story groups for full-stack features
- Applies smart labels (pre-planned + concern + detected keywords)
- Maintains natural dependencies between stories

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Command format
/plan-to-linear "feature idea description"

# Natural language (auto-triggers)
"I want to plan this feature"
"plan X for Linear"
"create stories for user authentication"
```
